# WalkToFolders_ExtractAndRename_Images
you need 3 libraries os, shutil and csv.

open the Terminal and sfter Upgrade, paste these:

pip install os-sys

pip install pytest-shutil

pip install python-csv

run rename_images.py file to walk between folders and rename all images from every folder and put all images that renamed in 1 folder.


I saved all images that renamed on CSV file with folder name.
